Bandit is a new coffee and matcha shop on North Lamar just past the river. Bandit has a wide selection of drinks and pastries to choose from along with a Lamar-facing patio to enjoy them on. Upon arrival they ask that you either download their app or use a provided kiosk to place your order in an attempt to maintain a contactless transaction which was highly appreciated.

Pictured (left to right) is an iced matcha latte, a hot latte, and an iced honey lavender matcha latte accompanied by a chocolate crescent and a blueberry doughnut. 

Matcha is definitely the go-to here. I'm a sucker for that slightly sweet, creamy flavor that matcha brings to the table and Bandit is obviously familiar and just as obsessed with it as I am. The matcha latte is made with ceremonial grade matcha, agave nectar, and milk which gives it a great amount of flavor and sweetness. Next time I come here I will absolutely be ordering this again.

The honey lavender variation on this drink was great, but just a little too sweet for my liking. With that being said, if you prefer your drinks more on the sweeter side I would confidently recommend that you try one of their matcha variations.
