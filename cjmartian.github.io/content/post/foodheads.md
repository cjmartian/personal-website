FoodHeads is a mostly outdoor sandwich spot on North Guadalupe that features large sandwiches, iced tea, and made-in-kitchen soups. If you ever needed a reason to go get some rainy day comfort food, this is it. FoodHeads features a comfortable, quiet outdoor seating area where you can listen to birds nesting in a nearby birdhouse while you enjoy their food.

What drew me into this place was their Barbecue Bahn Mi (pictured). This sandwich was not only delicious, it was a ton of food for a ridiculously low price. The brisket on this sandwich was so much better than I had expected and their take on a Bahn Mi was a welcomed surprise. With that being said, if you are a fan of Bahn Mi and are looking for something more tradiational, this is not the sandwich. If you, however, are looking for a creative, high quality barbecue sandwich I would highly recommend this place.
