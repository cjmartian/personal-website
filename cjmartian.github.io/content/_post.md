Try Hard Coffee is currently undergoing some renivations, due to which they are currently serving their coffee out of a pop-up tent across the street in a local food truck park.

Regardless of where they are serving their coffee, they have a very interesting and unique selection of drinks to select from. Pictured is one latte, one iced latte, and a coffee cola (left to right) along with two cream puff pasteries. 

The two lattes had shots that were pulled wonderfully and went well with the pastery that the barista, rightfully so, recommended that we try.

The coffee cola was described to me as having 'notes of vinegar' and was carbonated which was expected from the name. They topped this drink with some club soda and a splash of cola for sweetness. The flavor can be related to that of kombucha, so if you enjoy that flavor (or if you're just looking to try something out of the ordinary) I would recommend this drink.

I am looking forward to Try Hard Coffee's renivations to be complete so that we can all try their full menu, featuring their Matcha Rider.
